# Piperplate

This is a boilerplate for JavaScript projects, writting by me. Since it is annoying having to write this more than once, will do it just once ? aha.
It uses SCSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Webpack

## Structure

`shared` folder is for the assets (images, fonts, icons,etc) and webpack will copy then to public automatically.


`app` is where the heart of the app is, the entry point for webpack, the stars of the sky, the light of the dark, the peanut butter of the bread (or just the main).


`styles` that is pretty self explanatory, won't say anything more than it contains sass files and all its folders.


`public` is the public folder for production.
